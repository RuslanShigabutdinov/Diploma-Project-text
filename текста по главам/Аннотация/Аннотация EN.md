This thesis presents the development of an NFC bracelet for storing medical information. The bracelet allows you to store important information about the userâ€™s health, such as blood type, allergies, chronic diseases, medications taken and emergency contacts. Information can be accessed by scanning the bracelet using a smartphone or other NFC-enabled device. In the event of an emergency, doctors can send messages to all recorded contacts about the incident.

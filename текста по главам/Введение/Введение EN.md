Justification of the relevance of the topic
In today's world, where the pace of life is constantly accelerating and the amount of information is increasing exponentially, it has become increasingly important to have quick and easy access to vital information. This is especially true for people with health problems who may need to quickly provide information about their health in the event of an emergency.
Traditional methods of storing health information, such as paper records, can be inconvenient, unreliable, and easily lost. In this regard, there is an urgent need to develop new methods for storing and accessing medical information.
NFC bracelets are a new technology that can be used to solve this problem. NFC bracelets are wearable devices that use near-field communication (NFC) technology to store and transmit data. They are easy to use, do not require charging and can store a large amount of information.
Using NFC bracelets to store medical information can have a number of advantages:
In the event of an emergency, patient medical information can be quickly and easily accessed by doctors and rescuers.
The bracelet can help save lives by providing quick access to information about a person's health.
The bracelet is easy to use and does not need to be removed or charged.
Bracelet owners can be confident that their medical information will always be available in the event of an emergency.
Assessment of the current state of the problem being solved
In the modern world, where access to information is the key to success, the issue of storing and quickly accessing vital data, especially medical data, is becoming increasingly relevant. Traditional methods such as paper documents have a number of disadvantages that limit their effectiveness.
In this regard, the development of new, more advanced methods for storing medical information is one of the most important tasks in the field of healthcare.
Why NFC bracelets are the best option for storing medical information:
1. Ease of use:
NFC bracelets are easy to use. There's no need to download or install anything, just hold the bracelet up to your smartphone or other NFC-enabled device to read the information.
The bracelet can be worn on your hand, making it accessible at any time.
NFC bracelets do not require charging, which makes them convenient to use.
2. Increased security:
In the event of an emergency, rescuers can quickly identify the patient and access their vital medical information.
NFC bracelets can help reduce the risk of medication errors by providing doctors with accurate and up-to-date patient information.
Project goals
Our main goal is to develop an NFC bracelet that will serve as a reliable storage of medical information. We will achieve this by designing a secure and reliable system for storing and transmitting data, as well as creating software for the bracelet and mobile application that provides a user-friendly interface and functionality.
The bracelet will store key medical information such as blood types, allergies, chronic diseases, medications taken, contact information in case of emergency and the hospital to which it is assigned.
We want our bracelet to be available to a wide range of people. To achieve this, we will set a competitive price and make it easy to use. The bracelet interface will be understandable even to those who do not have special knowledge or skills.
We are developing a bracelet with a modular architecture, which will allow us to add new functions and capabilities in the future.
Our goal is to create an NFC bracelet that will become not just another gadget, but a real assistant that ensures the safety, health and peace of mind of people.

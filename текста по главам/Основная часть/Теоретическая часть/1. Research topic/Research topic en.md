*Research purposes*
Main goal: to develop and implement a system for storing medical information based on NFC bracelets, providing safe, convenient and effective access to vital information about patients in case of emergency. This includes:
1. *Research* existing methods of storing and transmitting medical information, identifying their advantages and disadvantages.
2. *Analyze* the requirements for a medical information storage system based on NFC bracelets, taking into account the needs of patients, medical personnel and medical institutions.
3. *Develop* a system architecture, including NFC bracelets, a web platform and a server part.
4. *Create* software for the web platform and server part, ensuring the functionality of the system, security and confidentiality of medical information.
5. *Simulate the implementation* of the system in a medical institution and conduct testing to assess its effectiveness, performance and safety.
6. *Assess* the impact of the system on the quality of medical care, patient satisfaction and the work of medical staff.
*Research methodology*
*1 Analysis of existing solutions*
First of all, the research will analyze various medical information storage systems using NFC technology. This will allow you to compare the functionality, architecture, software and other characteristics of existing systems, as well as identify the advantages and disadvantages of existing solutions, which will allow you to take them into account when developing your own system.
*2 System development*
Based on the data obtained, the system architecture will be designed, including hardware and software.
The development of software for the website will be a key step, since it will ensure the functionality of the system, the security and confidentiality of medical information.
Thorough testing of your software will identify and fix bugs and optimize your software for maximum performance and usability.
*3 Simulation of system performance*
The next stage will be a simulation of the implementation of the system in a medical institution. This will allow us to test our project in action, understand its impact on everyday life and find flaws in our idea
To evaluate the effectiveness of the developed medical information storage system, data collection will be organized, including two main areas: collection of quantitative and qualitative data.
*Collection of quantitative data: *
- Analysis of system log files: Indicators such as the number of users, frequency of use of the system, time spent searching and accessing information, etc. will be tracked. This will provide information about how often the system is used, which functions are most in demand, and which sections of the site are visited most often.
- User survey: Questionnaires will be developed that will be filled out by system users. Questionnaires may contain questions about how convenient it is for users to work with the system, how well it meets their expectations, what functions they find most useful, etc.
*Qualitative data collection:*
- User reviews about the system that they leave on the website or on social networks will be analyzed. This will allow you to obtain information about what users think about the system, what complaints and suggestions they have about it.
- Observation will be carried out of how users work with the system. This will identify possible problems and difficulties they encounter while using the system.
*Expected results***
- With quick and accurate access to vital information about patients, doctors will be able to quickly and accurately diagnose diseases, prescribe treatment and make decisions in emergency situations.
- The system will allow medical staff to save time searching for and accessing information about patients, which will allow them to pay more attention to the patients themselves.
- Patients will receive better and faster medical care, which will increase their satisfaction with the work of medical institutions.
*Significance and Impact*
- Theoretical: expands knowledge in the field of storing medical information using NFC technologies, and also proposes a new model of a medical information storage system that can be used in other medical institutions.
- Practical: Provides a practical solution to the problem of storing and accessing medical information in the event of an emergency. Can be used to improve the quality of health care around the world.
Thus, the development of a system for storing medical information based on NFC bracelets and a website is a relevant and promising task, which is of great importance for the development of the healthcare system and improving the quality of life of people.
